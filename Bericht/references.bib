	title = {Graceful {Navigation} for {Mobile} {Robots} in {Dynamic} and {Uncertain} {Environments}},
	abstract = {The ability to navigate in everyday environments is a fundamental and necessary skill
for any autonomous mobile agent that is intended to work with human users. The presence
of pedestrians and other dynamic objects, however, makes the environment inherently dy-
namic and uncertain. To navigate in such environments, an agent must reason about the
near future and make an optimal decision at each time step so that it can move safely to-
ward the goal. Furthermore, for any application intended to carry passengers, it also must
be able to move smoothly and comfortably, and the robot behavior needs to be customiz-
able to match the preference of the individual users. Despite decades of progress in the field
of motion planning and control, this remains a difficult challenge with existing methods.
Specifically, we require robot navigation in dynamic and uncertain environments to be
safe, comfortable, and customizable. For safety in dynamic and uncertain environments,
our algorithm guarantees probabilistic safety, rather than trying to provide absolute colli-
sion avoidance which quickly becomes impossible in cluttered and crowded environments.
That is, with our algorithm the robot will (i) continually try to minimize (to near zero) the
potential cost of collision due to robot motion, (ii) avoid moving when it is already in a col-
lision state, and (iii) try to maximize the progress toward the goal if and only if there exists
trajectories that are likely to be feasible. Also, for comfort and customizability, we explic-
itly consider the quality of motion, but without affecting our probabilistic safety guarantee,
so that the robot motion matches the preference of the individual users.
In this dissertation, we show that safe, comfortable, and customizable mobile robot
navigation in dynamic and uncertain environments can be achieved via stochastic model
predictive control. We view the problem of navigation in dynamic and uncertain environ-
ments as a continuous decision making process, where an agent with short-term predictive
capability reasons about its situation and makes an informed decision at each time step.
The problem of robot navigation in dynamic and uncertain environments is formulated
as an on-line, finite-horizon policy and trajectory optimization problem under uncertainty.
With our formulation, planning and control becomes fully integrated, which allows direct
optimization of the performance measure. Furthermore, with our approach the problem
becomes easy to solve, which allows our algorithm to run in real time on a single core of a
typical laptop with off-the-shelf optimization packages.
This depends on four specific technical contributions. We define our expected cost so
that we can directly incorporate the time-varying uncertain constraints and the probabil-
ity of violating those constraints into the cost function, which tends to create a smooth
cost surface that is easy to optimize over. The dimensionality reduction of this problem
critically depends on the policy and closed-loop trajectory parameterization based on a
Lyapunov-based feedback control law, which we developed for graceful motion of dif-
ferential wheeled mobile robots. The stability of this stochastic model predictive control
critically depends on a non-holonomic distance function, which we define as a Control-
Lyapunov function for unicycle-type vehicles. We also develop a motor and friction dy-
namics model of the robot for more accurate forward prediction.
We demonstrate that our method generates graceful (safe, smooth, comfortable, fast,
and intuitive) and customizable robot behavior in physical environments with pedestrians
in real time. The work presented in this thesis extends the state-of-the-art in analytic control
of mobile robots, sampling-based optimal path planning, and stochastic model predictive
control. We believe that this work is a significant step toward safe and reliable autonomous
navigation that is acceptable to human users.},

Mobile robots must be moved to the relevant task point in order to be able to fulfill the tasks assigned to them. However, the movements planned in a frame or random may affect the duty time and even in some situations, the duty might be failed. When such problems are taken into consideration, it is expected that the robots should go to the task point and complete their tasks within the shortest time and most suitable way. It is aimed to give results about a comparison of some known algorithms. With this thought, a map for a real time environment has been created and the appropriateness of the algorithms are investigated with respect to the described starting/end points. According to the results, the shortest path is found by the A* algorithm. However, it is observed that the time efficiency of this algorithm very low. On the other hand, PRM algorithm is the most suitable method in terms of elapsed time. In addition to this, algorithm path length is closer to the A* algorithm. The results are analyzed and commented according to the statistical analysis methods.},

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor "anytime" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT\% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods.

	abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

	abstract = {A new type of control law is derived to steer the dynamic model of a wheeled robot of unicycle type along a desired path. The methodology adopted for path following control deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics and plant parameter uncertainty. Furthermore, it overcomes stringent initial condition constraints that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a ‘virtual target’ to be tracked along the path, thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the virtual target is simply defined by the projection of the actual vehicle on that path. In the paper, a nonlinear adaptive control law is derived that yields convergence of the (closed-loop system) path following error trajectories to zero. Controller design relies on Lyapunov theory and backstepping techniques. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) and the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), have received a large and growing amount of attention during the past decade. Most recently, sampling-based algorithms, such as the PRM* and RRT*, that guarantee asymptotic optimality, i.e., almost-sure convergence towards optimal solutions, have been proposed. Despite the experimental success of asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithms, their extensions to handle complex non-holonomic dynamical systems remains largely an open problem. In this paper, with the help of results from differential geometry, we extend the RRT* algorithm to handle a large class of non-holonomic dynamical systems. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in computational experiments involving the Dubins' car dynamics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5088},
	abstract = {We present Kinodynamic RRT*, an incremental sampling-based approach for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robots with linear differential constraints. Our approach extends RRT*, which was introduced for holonomic robots (Karaman et al. 2011), by using a fixed-final-state-free-final-time controller that exactly and optimally connects any pair of states, where the cost function is expressed as a trade-off between the duration of a trajectory and the expended control effort. Our approach generalizes earlier work on extending RRT* to kinodynamic systems, as it guarantees asymptotic optimality for any system with controllable linear dynamics, in state spaces of any dimension. Our approach can be applied to non-linear dynamics as well by using their first-order Taylor approximations. In addition, we show that for the rich subclass of systems with a nilpotent dynamics matrix, closed-form solutions for optimal trajectories can be derived, which keeps the computational overhead of our algorithm compared to traditional RRT* at a minimum. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by computing asymptotically optimal trajectories in three challenging motion planning scenarios: (i) a planar robot with a 4-D state space and double integrator dynamics, (ii) an aerial vehicle with a 10-D state space and linearized quadrotor dynamics, and (iii) a car-like robot with a 5-D state space and non-linear dynamics.},
